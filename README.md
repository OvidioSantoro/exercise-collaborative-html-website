# Exercise Collaborative HTML Website

> By Ovidio Santoro and Keili Rosales

## Objective

The exercise is intended to practice the skills acquired in GIT while developing a typical website, so the Landing Page was divided into two general sections Upper half (Ovidio) and lower half (Keili).

The main theme selected for the website, is the chef of the restaurant El Bohío (Illescas) with a Michelin star and jury of the Spanish edition of MasterChef, Pepe Martinez.

Three sections were created that make up the general lower half section.
	- Recipes
	- Team
	- Subscription

###### Recipes
The aim is to represent in a friendly and intuitive way the recipes made by Pepe, being separated by tabs according to the type of preparation Traditional, Tasting and Seasonal, in each one will be explained its preparation and the ingredients needed. 
In a first view, the photograph of the dish will appear with the title of the recipe and a brief description of the content (using fake text).

###### Team
The content is separated with another container, using a different color (El Bohío color palette) to differentiate one section from another.
Here we seek to comment on the effort of the team behind the kitchens of El Bohío and that together with Pepe can make the restaurant work, some carousel photographs of their preparations are shown.

###### Subscription
A brief call to action for users to get a voucher to give a tasting as a gift to a special person, and they are invited to get it by leaving their email in the box on the right side.
